# OSIRIS Governance & Authority Control Plane

`osiris-governance` provides the deterministic capability governor and provider-neutral authority boundary for the OSIRIS ecosystem.

## Core Architectural Invariants

1. **Cognition Proposes; Governance Authorizes**: No cognitive substrate (Gemini, Antigravity, local model, or replay fixture) possesses execution authority. Substrates generate serialized `ActionProposal` records only.
2. **Deterministic Byte Binding**: Authorization decisions bind strictly to the exact serialized canonical bytes of the proposal via SHA-256. Any byte modification invalidates the binding.
3. **Fail-Closed Execution**: Action proposals are denied unless explicitly permitted by policy. All denials occur *prior* to adapter invocation.
4. **Zero Filesystem Authority in Replay**: In the offline replay slice, the adapter has zero filesystem, subprocess, network, or environment access.
5. **Non-Authoritative Replay Permits**: In offline replay, execution tokens are typed `ReplayExecutionPermit` with scope `REPLAY_ONLY_NON_CRYPTOGRAPHIC`. They confer zero authority for real-world side effects.
